This is a cloud generator inspired by Cipriani & Giri's Vol. 3 gen~ example. I used our old port of Sakonda's linear MSP granulator as the basis to respond to cloud generation messages. 

It uses the PD object, clone.
This runs at 22050 sampling rate on the Bela Pepper
8 instances with 128 sample block size runs at 58% CPU
12 instances run at 256 block at 68% CPU
16 instances will run, but at 256 block size, and 83% CPU
